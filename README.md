# MyReads Project by David Lorenz

This is the project of the Udacity course for React nanodegree of *David Lorenz*.

## TL;DR

To get started do the following:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

## What can you expect?

* On the startpage you will find 3 shelves which belong to you and where you can categorize/add/remove books
* When you click on the +-Icon in the bottom right you are able to add more books to your shelves
    * You can only use the search terms provided in SEARCH_TERMS.md
    * You will notice that books that are already in your belongings will look differently to indicate their state more easily
